<h1>Skills vs CGPA: What Matters More in Engineering?</h1>

<p>Most first-year students get stuck between two extremes: either they chase CGPA only, or they ignore it completely.</p>

<h2>CGPA helps early</h2>
<p>It can help with eligibility and shortlisting in some situations.</p>

<h2>Skills decide long-term career</h2>
<p>Skills help you get better work, internships, and confidence.</p>

<h2>The balanced approach</h2>
<p>Maintain a decent CGPA while improving skills slowly. You don’t need to rush.</p>
