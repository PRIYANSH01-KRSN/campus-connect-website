<h1>Is CGPA Really Important in Engineering?</h1>

<p>CGPA matters, but it’s not everything. The real problem is students either over-fear it or ignore it completely.</p>

<h2>Where CGPA matters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Shortlisting for some internships</li>
  <li>Higher studies eligibility</li>
  <li>First job screening (sometimes)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where CGPA matters less</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Skill-based roles</li>
  <li>Long-term growth</li>
  <li>Real-world performance</li>
</ul>

<h2>The best approach</h2>
<p>Aim for a decent CGPA, but don’t destroy your mental health. Build skills alongside academics.</p>
