<h1>How to Manage Time in Engineering College Without Stress</h1>

<p>Time management advice online often feels unrealistic. The goal is not perfection — the goal is consistency.</p>

<h2>1) Don’t over-schedule</h2>
<p>If you plan every minute, you’ll fail quickly. Leave breathing space.</p>

<h2>2) Prioritize daily</h2>
<p>Every morning ask: what matters most today? Do that first.</p>

<h2>3) Consistency beats motivation</h2>
<p>Small focused daily action is better than random bursts.</p>
